# MOLSH

My own little shell!

This project is meant to learn a bit of the C programming language, and has a small scope because of it. I just want this shell to have some POSIX compatibility and some builtins (like `echo`, `ls`, and others).

Building and anything required to use this program will be included in `Makefile`
